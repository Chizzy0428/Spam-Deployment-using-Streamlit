### Spam Classification Project Description

The **Spam Classification Project** is a machine learning application designed to predict whether a given message is spam or not. The project demonstrates end-to-end development, from data preprocessing and model training to web application deployment. Here's an overview of the key components:

---

#### **Project Features:**
- **Model**: Built using the Naive Bayes algorithm, which is highly effective for text classification tasks such as spam detection.
- **Pipeline**: A seamless preprocessing and classification pipeline integrates data vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF) with the trained Naive Bayes model.
- **Web Application**: The app is deployed on **Streamlit Community Cloud**, offering a user-friendly interface where users can input messages and instantly receive classification results (Spam/Not Spam).
- **Deployment**: Accessible online for demonstration and testing without requiring local setup.
- **Codebase**: All project code, including the model and web app implementation, is available in a public

---

#### **How It Works:**
1. Users enter a message in the app.
2. The message is preprocessed and passed through the Naive Bayes pipeline.
3. The app predicts whether the message is spam or not and displays the result.

#### **Technologies Used:**
- **Python**: For data preprocessing, model training, and app development.
- **Scikit-learn**: To implement the Naive Bayes model and preprocessing steps.
- **Streamlit**: To build and deploy the interactive web application.
- **GitHub**: To host the project code and track version control.
